## 1. Problem Statement

Our project is related to Agri tech sector. When we were thinking about agri-tech the first problem that came into our minds are weed plants.
Weeds often causes a huge a loss for the farmers. 
 
Weeds consume a lot of water and nutrients from the soil, which eventually creates the problem for the original crop. Few Weeds also acts as home for pests which results in crop damage.

To eradicate these , farmers are spending a huge amount of capital in purchasing pesticides and we all know how dangerous the pesticides are. The main problem is, farmer are unable to identify whether a plant is weed or not. They are able to realise it only, once the crop getting damaged. 



## 2. Technological solution for the problem

- By using the present day technology we found an effective and an efficient solution for this problem. With the help of Deep learning we can overcome this.
- Let us see how deep learning helps us. Using DL we can find whether a plant is weed or not. If it is weed the farmer will take an action using the recommendation system we build. DL also identifies at which part of the field there are weeds and etc. Finding the weeds is the biggest task for any farmer.
- While spraying pesticides farmer sprays it on the crop. But by using this and Drone technology we can use pesticides exactly on the weeds but not on other crops in the fields.



## 3. Uses

- Less usage pesticides as we spray only on the particular weed plant.
- Gives better recommendation for the farmers on how to eradicate  once the weed gets identified
- Identification of weeds takes place within no time.
- Healthy crops due to less pesticides
- Decreases the capital investment for the farmers as they no need buy the pesticides for entire crop.


## 4. Scalability and Business uss case

- We have chosen this problem because it is affecting our countryâ€™s major sector (Agriculture)  that too on a major scale.
- We believe this not only acts as a successful business idea but also a great contribution for revolutionary technology in the Agricultural sector.
